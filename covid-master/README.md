# anZen - The Contact Tracing Application

## Overview:

Our app _“anZen”_ aims to overcome the current limitations of the “Arogya Setu” app by implementing the following features:

* Real-time contact tracing & distance alerts, even if other people do not have the app installed

* Alerting users via push notifications if they are present in the vicinity with multiple medium to high-risk people.

* Live-updates with visual representations of cumulative cases in India as well as in a particular state. 

* Reporting oneself as Covid +ve.

* The app also contains various guidelines & articles about:

* Maintaining social-distancing protocols.

* Symptoms observed by Covid +ve patients.

* Proper sanitization measures to be taken by an individual at home, work & in public places.
